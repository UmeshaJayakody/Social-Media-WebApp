## Features

### **User Authentication and Authorization**

- **Registration:**  
  Users can sign up by providing their **name**, **email**, and **password**. Once registered, they can log in securely using their email and password.  

- **Login Process:**  
  The login process is managed using a **JWT (JSON Web Token)** system for secure authentication. The token expiration time is variable and can be configured via the `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` variable in the `.env` file.  

- **Token Expiry:**  
  If the token expires, users are automatically redirected to the login page, where they can log in again to refresh their session with a new token.  

- **Visual Clarification:**  
  The following screenshots provide a clearer understanding of the user authentication flow. 

  - **Login**

    - The **home page** displays posts from all users, allowing for a broader view of the platform's content.

  - **Profile Interaction:**  
    - Users have the ability to visit other profiles and engage with their content.
